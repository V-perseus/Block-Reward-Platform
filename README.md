What is Block Reward?

    Block Reward is taking advantage of the paradigm shift from physical to digital and will disrupt the reward systems industry by using NFTs and tokenized rewards. NFTs hosted on the Algorand blockchain allow Block Reward to create new members quickly through instant minting, verify membership in a secure fashion and give shoppers direct ownership of the rewards they earn.

What are Block Reward NFTs and Block Reward Token?

    Block Reward NFTs act as the virtual membership card for consumers. Businesses will sell these NFTs acting as premium memberships. The NFTs purchase fee facilitates the purchase of the Algorand blockchain that is used to store and facilitate data on the blockchain. Block Reward provides both the hardware and software to facilitate transactions and plans to provide a smooth onboarding experience for users.
    Block Reward Tokens (BRT) are earned when consumers purchase from businesses that are in the Block Rewards Ecosystem. Customers can use the tokens they earn to redeemdiscounts, limited-time offers or other promotional activities. Hosting these tokens on the Algorand Blockchain allows for easy accounting of rewards in circulation and can provide business analytics through its public ledger.

Block Reward Application

    Block Reward is the platform where BRT is redeemed and used. Businesses will have their own page offering promotional content along with discount offers. When a user owns a business’ NFT, then that particular business’ page can be accessed to redeem their Block Reward Tokens for promotions or discounts. Owning just 1 NFT within the Block Reward ecosystem gives you access to certain discounts in other businesses but full rewards will be reserved for the holders of the business’ NFT. This system allows interoperability between businesses that previously was impossible. As Block Reward grows, we plan to expand this ecosystem. Stay Tuned!
