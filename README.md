What is Block Reward?

    Block Reward is a membership and a reward system for retailers, both in person and online. Our mission is to connect business and customers in an easy and unique fashion. Business will offer memberships through our platform, doing this exposes potential customers to new discount opportunities. We are excited to have a platform for business and customers to easily connect, on our platform business have a dedicated page for discounts and special offers to be posted. All owners of a Block Reward membership have access to this page, but full discounts and promotions are reserved for full business members.  This system allows interoperability between businesses and takes advantage of shared customers
    

What are Block Reward NFTs and Block Reward Token?

    Block Reward Memberships are NFTs minted on the Algorand Blockchain. NFTs and blockchain are a unique way for businesses to protect the authenticity of membership and an easy way for businesses to track discounts redeemed by their customers
    Block Reward Token is earned on purchases made from a business within our ecosystem, think of BRT as a reward point. Our token is used to redeem discounts, limited-time offers and other promotional activities offered by businesses on our platform. Users can also use the token to upgrade their membership tier within the system. There may be ways to gain more BRT in the future through our platform.

Block Reward Application

    Block Reward is the platform where BRT is redeemed and used. Businesses will have their own page offering promotional content along with discount offers. When a user owns a business’ NFT, then that particular business’ page can be accessed to redeem their Block Reward Tokens for promotions or discounts. Owning just 1 NFT within the Block Reward ecosystem gives you access to certain discounts in other businesses but full rewards will be reserved for the holders of the business’ NFT. This system allows interoperability between businesses that previously was impossible. As Block Reward grows, we plan to expand this ecosystem. Stay Tuned!
